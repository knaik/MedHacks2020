The wifi is supposedly connected but doesn't return a ping response it times out

The card is readable 

so the filesystem got corrupted. 


E: Sub-process returned an error code
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo apt-get upgrade
Segmentation fault
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ls
-bash: /bin/ls: Input/output error


now I have a VM booted up and installing gparted to see what I can recover

that did not work
damn I have to deal with partitions
335am sat

finished reflashing
now i have to resetup networking. and i will have to do that again at cousins
house
426am

i forgot to put the wifi adapter back on and was wondering why it didn't respond to a ping
