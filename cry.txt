The wifi is supposedly connected but doesn't return a ping response it times out

The card is readable 

so the filesystem got corrupted. 


E: Sub-process returned an error code
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo apt-get upgrade
Segmentation fault
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ ls
-bash: /bin/ls: Input/output error


now I have a VM booted up and installing gparted to see what I can recover
